This directory is used to automatically stored vcr cassettes of scenario tagged with `:vcr`.

The first time the scenario is run, the external calls will be sent and their respective responses will
be stored in a cassette. Then the the consequent run of the scenario will use the previsouly stored cassette.

One can always delete the cassette in order to regenerate it when the scenario will be next run.
